# Raven
Raven works like a simplified SSH with NAT traversal.

Now developing...
But you can still have a test for fun!
Just fill server_ip in Raven.conf and excute ./build.sh.
Oh,your server is supposed to have a public IPV4 ip.

If you are intrested in it for further development, please contact me.
